# TeamNamePicker

Ever have that awful feeling where you need a name for a team for a project or competition, but can't think of a good one off the top of your head?  This project was created to combat that very situation!

The repository is made of a whopping TWO FILES (other than this readme):
1. **TeamNames.txt** - A list of potential team names (many are Wright State/Eric Buck related).  Feel free to add to the list and push it back to this repo!
2. **TeamNamePicker.py** - As you're probably aware, this is a simple python script that picks a team name at random from the list.

## Usage
* Clone this repository (or pull it if you've already cloned it to make sure you've got all the best possible team names)
* Open the directory in your favorite shell
* ```python TeamNamePicker.py```
* And voila!  You've got a team name picked!

While you're at it, add some fun team names to the text file and push it back to share with everyone!

Now go find something fun to do that requires starting a team!
